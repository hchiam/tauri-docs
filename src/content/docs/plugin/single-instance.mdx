<PluginLinks plugin="single-instance" showJsLinks={false} />

Ensure that a single instance of your tauri app is running at a time using the Single Instance Plugin. Can be integrated with the [deep link](/plugin/deep-linking) plugin out of the box.

## Setup

Install the Single Instance plugin to get started.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Automatic">

    Use your project's package manager to add the dependency:

    {' '}

    <CommandTabs
      npm="npm run tauri add single-instance"
      yarn="yarn run tauri add single-instance"
      pnpm="pnpm tauri add single-instance"
      bun="bun tauri add single-instance"
      cargo="cargo tauri add single-instance"
    />

  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Manual">
      <Steps>

        1. Run the following command in the `src-tauri` folder to add the plugin to the project's dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:

            ```sh frame=none
            cargo add tauri-plugin-single-instance --target 'cfg(any(target_os = "macos", windows, target_os = "linux"))'
            ```

        2.  Modify `lib.rs` to initialize the plugin:

            ```rust title="lib.rs" ins={5-6}
            #[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]
            pub fn run() {
                tauri::Builder::default()
                    .setup(|app| {
                        #[cfg(desktop)]
                        app.handle().plugin(tauri_plugin_single_instance::init(|app, args, cwd| {}));
                        Ok(())
                    })
                    .run(tauri::generate_context!())
                    .expect("error while running tauri application");
            }
            ```

      </Steps>
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Usage

The plugin is already installed and initialized, and it should be functioning correctly right away. Nevertheless, we can also enhance its functionality with the `init()` method.

The plugin `init()` method takes a closure that is invoked when a new app instance was started, but closed by the plugin.
The closure has three arguments:

  <Steps>

1. **`app`:** The [AppHandle](https://docs.rs/tauri/2.0.0-rc/tauri/struct.AppHandle.html) of the application.
2. **`args`:** The list of arguments, that was passed by the user to initiate this new instance.
3. **`cwd`:** The Current Working Directory denotes the directory from which the new application instance was launched.

  </Steps>

So, the closure should look like below

```rust
.plugin(tauri_plugin_single_instance::init(|app, args, cwd| {
  // Write your code here...
}))
```

Note that currently, plugins run in the order they were added in to the builder, so make sure that this plugin is registered first.

### Focusing on New Instance

By default, when you initiate a new instance while the application is already running, no action is taken. To focus the window of the running instance when user tries to open a new instance, alter the callback closure as follows:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs" {1} {5-7} {12-21}
use tauri::{AppHandle, Manager};

pub fn run() {
    let mut builder = tauri::Builder::default();
    #[cfg(desktop)]
    {
        builder = builder.plugin(tauri_plugin_single_instance::init(|app, args, cwd| {
            let _ = show_window(app);
        }));
    }

    builder
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}

fn show_window(app: &AppHandle) {
    let windows = app.webview_windows();

    windows
        .values()
        .next()
        .expect("Sorry, no window found")
        .set_focus()
        .expect("Can't Bring Window to Focus");
}
```

### Plugin Deep Link Integration

Note that when using deep link plugin it will emit events on macOS, iOS, and Android. However, on Windows and Linux, the operating system will launch a new instance of your app with the URL as a command-line argument. 

To make your app behave consistently across all platforms (including Windows and Linux), you should enable the deep-link integration as follows:

```rust title="Cargo.toml" {2}
[dependencies]
tauri-plugin-single-instance = { version = "2.0.0-rc", features = ["deep-link"] }
```
